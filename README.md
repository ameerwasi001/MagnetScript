# MagnetScript
This is a pretty simple language or a python framework for people who want to keep things simple while also making scientific simulations and calculations.

For now there are very few methods/functions in this framework/language compared to many but, I am continuously developing it. For now it's a bit slow but I am trying to find a soulution so, if any one of you have any suggestion please help me.
